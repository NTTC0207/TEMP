The most liquid asset among the ones listed is cash. Liquidity refers to how quickly and easily an asset can be converted into cash without significant loss of value. Cash is already in its most liquid form, while buildings, land, and furniture would need to be sold or converted to cash, which can take time and may involve loss of value.

A budget is a plan of action, expressed in monetary terms, that covers a specifled time period. Correct statements about budgets incude
that budgets can be used as steering controls and concurrent controls, but not as feedback controls
that the most important aspect of a budget varlance is whether it is positive or negative
that a budget variance is the differencabetween actual results and anticipated results
all of the above
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The correct answer is that a budget variance is the difference between actual results and anticipated results.

Here's why:

Budgets can be used as steering controls, concurrent controls, and feedback controls. They help guide actions (steering), monitor ongoing performance (concurrent), and evaluate past performance (feedback).
The importance of a budget variance is not solely whether it is positive or negative but also the reasons behind it and its implications for future planning and control.
Therefore, not all the statements are correct, making that a budget variance is the difference between actual results and anticipated results the accurate choice.

It seems like you're referring to a question from the LOMA 291 exam. Here's a breakdown that might help:

Line functions in an insurance company typically involve roles that directly contribute to the company's core activities, like acquiring, underwriting, and servicing insurance products. Support functions, on the other hand, provide services that assist these core activities but don't directly generate revenue.

For line functions, customer service is often considered one, as it directly impacts the customer experience, retention, and satisfaction, which are core to the business.

Accounting, corporate communications, and compliance are more likely to be considered support functions, as they aid the business but don't engage directly with the core business of selling or managing insurance products.

So, based on this, customer service is most likely the correct answer for a line function.
